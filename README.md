# EdenVim ‚Äî Craft your personal IDE experience

A perfect starting point for your personal, full-featured Neovim config. No convoluted layers, just a clean and intuitive setup to kickstart your PDE (Personalized Development Environment) journey.

If you came here looking for a pre-made, full-blown Neovim IDE, then you also may be in the right place, actually. Chances are you're on the same path I was ‚Äî [Why EdenVim? My Neovim Journey](#why-edenvim--my-neovim-journey).

As a bonus, your Neovim configuration would [work the same way on Nix-based systems like NixOS](#using-edenvim-based-configurations-with-nix-and-nixos), too!

## Features

- üç¥**Fork & Craft** This is _your_ configuration, the starting point. No _"don't touch **our** base config, clone a starter repository and go with it_".
- üè∞**But enjoy stability** Protected from breaking changes via Lazy.nvim lockfile. If you forked, just pull our changes to your configuration, no need to maintain plugin versions.
- ‚ö°**Fast** 45ms startup with lazy-loading and Lua bytecode caching (vs 90ms AstroNvim, 80ms LazyVim, 50ms NvChad).
- ü™∂**Small** ~2500 lines of code, mostly plugin settings and explicitly defined defaults.
- üéÆ**Tools that work immediately** Pre-configured common LSP, debug adapters, linters, and diagnostics installed automatically using `mason.nvim` or externally with tools like Nix.
- ü™ü**Out-of-the-box transparency** It just works for most color schemes.
- üåÄ**No wrapping** Direct plugin usage ‚Äî use everything explicitly, no _"lang packs"_ or _"theme loaders".
- üß∂**Minimal interdependencies** Related things are placed together, no _"taking icons from here, fetching settings from there, extending default options"_. The exception is key mappings ‚Äî we keep them in one place.
- üå±**Extend Neovim, not replace it** We want you to learn Neovim, not another IDE. No `<leader>lm` instead of `:Mason` or `<leader><tab>n` instead of builtin `gt`, and so on.
- ü¶â**Simplicity over hiding** should we write code to hide a `Switch C/C++ header/source file` keybinding when you're in a Python file? For us, the answer is no ‚Äî we trust you, and your journey is simpler without extensive checks and autocommand chains.
- üèÜ**Exceptional support of C/C++ and Rust** Correct configuration of `clangd_extensions.nvim`, include-based autocompletion, etc. I used it to navigate complex Rust projects and Linux kernel (just be sure to [generate compile_commands.json for kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/scripts/clang-tools/gen_compile_commands.py)).
- üéØ**Sane defaults** Things you'll do anyway. For instance, many dislike being unable to save a root-owned file if they forgot to use `sudo` or `sudoedit`.

## Why EdenVim? My Neovim Journey

My path started with IDEs like IDEA, CLion, and VS Code. At first, I tried to get "the most powerful" Neovim setup. Intuitively, I treated it as a pre-made IDE, although it's a PDE platform.

I tried AstroNvim, LunarVim, LazyVim, and NvChad. I was overwhelmed by complexity ‚Äî not only did I have to learn Vim, Neovim, and Lua, but I also had to navigate configuration-specific abstractions. I even had to create a Neovim configuration switcher to navigate between my setups. In the end, I settled on NvChad ‚Äî it felt less bloated and had a noticeable presence on YouTube.

It went well until I decided to remove "close all" and "toggle dark/light theme" buttons. For something that I've never used, they consumed too much screen real estate. Surprisingly, it became a time-consuming endeavor. I discovered that it was hard-coded in NvChad's dependencies: to fix this, I had to change the `NvChad UI` plugin, breaking all future updates.

The consensus on the Neovim subreddit was clear: in the end, most people craft their own configuration. The advice is to start with templates like `Neovim-from-scratch` or `kickstart.nvim`. This time, I was sure: they're not being elitist, it is genuine advice.

Some templates were outdated, while others hadn't incorporated even basic tools like `Lazy.nvim`. Still, it was a breath of fresh air ‚Äî you do everything yourself, gaining understanding and remembering your keymaps. I went with `nvim-basic-ide` template.

Soon, a new challenge arose ‚Äî plugin authors occasionally introduce literally breaking changes that can ruin your workday. This is where pre-built configurations shine ‚Äî they fix updates or give the ability to rollback to the clean installation. Having taken "do it yourself" approach, I spent a lot of time creating my own full-featured stable configuration. I was lucky to have some spare time, but I doubt everyone has it.

As you may have guessed, EdenVim is my solution ‚Äî you still follow the "do it yourself" approach but with more speed and less frustration. The goal is to bridge the gaps between _"I've installed it"_, _"It works for my projects"_, and _"I can customize my PDE"_. Although these stages don't coincide in practice, the aim is to make them overlap as much as possible. Moreover, if you're familiar with Vim, you'll become productive in just a day or two ‚Äî I've tested it with my friends.

## Using EdenVim-based configurations with Nix and NixOS

Setting up Neovim on Nix-driven systems is often tricky when it comes to managing external binary dependencies like LSP servers.
Neovim users frequently modify files in `~/.config/nvim`, and tools like `mason.nvim` dynamically install formatters, LSP servers, and other binaries at runtime.
Both conflicts with Nix's philosophy of reproducible builds and immutability. This often results in dilemma to either go Nix-first or Neovim-first,
which is very unsatifying as in principle, Nix and Neovim look like a match in heaven.

While excellent projects like [nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim) offer Nix-first Neovim installations, in practice many users prefer their Neovim configuration
to remain Nix-agnostic for portability.

### Solution: Nix for binary dependencies, Lazy.nvim for plugin management, `.config/nvim` for configuration

With EdenVim, you can disable Mason-based plugins on Nix systems and manage external tools like LSP servers via Nix. This means:

- Your Neovim configuration remains in `~/.config/nvim` and is non-immutable, so you can customize it without rebuilding.
- External dependencies are managed by Nix, ensuring that setup is reproducible in term of binary dependencies.
- It works on non-Nix systems just as usual, and no parts of Nix "leak" into your Lua files.

### Setting Up EdenVim with Home Manager

You don't have to use [Home Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/), but it simplifies the process. Here's how you can set up EdenVim with Home Manager:

#### 1. Enable Neovim in Home Manager

First, enable Neovim and set up isolated environments for Python and Node.js, which are often needed by Neovim plugins.

```nix
programs.neovim = {
  enable = true;
  withPython3 = true;
  withNodeJs = true;
};
```

#### 2. Install LSP Servers and Tools via Nix

Instead of using `mason`, `mason-lspconfig`, `mason-dap` to install binary dependencies, declare them in the `programs.neovim.extraPackages` option.
This ensures all your tools are managed by Nix and are available within Neovim when it is launched. They don't pollute global environment.
**Note**: I cross-referenced some common tools installed by Mason (some of them extracted from VS Code) to corresponding `nixpkgs` packages, see the list in the [Full Example to Copy and Paste](#full-example-to-copy-and-paste) section.

```nix
programs.neovim.extraPackages = with pkgs; [
  bash-language-server
  rust-analyzer
  # ... Other LSP servers, formatters, linters, etc ...
];
```

#### 3. Link or Clone Your Neovim Configuration

First, you can manually clone or place your Neovim configuration in `~/.config/nvim` and skip this step.

If you manage your Neovim configuration as a Git submodule or just a directory within your Nix-based dotfiles repository, try using a symlink.
To keep Neovim configuration in `~/.config/nvim` editable, symlink it using the `xdg.configFile` option with the `mkOutOfStoreSymlink` function.
It works like this: `mkOutOfStoreSymlink` returns a path in the Nix store, but the path itself is just a symlink that resolves to the specified path.

```nix
xdg.configFile."nvim".source = config.lib.file.mkOutOfStoreSymlink "/home/username/dotfiles/config/nvim";
```

Make sure to replace `"/home/username/dotfiles/config/nvim"` with the **actual absolute path** to your Neovim configuration.
If you use Flakes, your dotfiles are copied to the Nix store first, so during evaluation relative paths will resolved inside a Nix store. An absolute path ensures linking works correctly.

#### 4. Disable Mason

This is the only change you need to make inside your Neovim configuration to use it on Nix systems versus non-Nix systems.
Since external tools are managed by Nix, we need to disable `mason.nvim`. In EdenVim-based configurations, ensure to set `g.mason_enabled = false` in `lua/options.lua`.
This tells EdenVim not to use `mason.nvim`, preventing it from trying to download tools at runtime and causing errors.
If you're using a different Neovim setup, you can disable Mason in your `lazy.nvim` configuration like this:

```lua
require("lazy").setup({
  -- ...
  spec = {
    -- ...
    -- Disable mason.nvim, mason-lspconfig.nvim, and other mason-related plugins
    { "williamboman/mason.nvim", enabled = false },
    { "williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim", enabled = false },
    -- ...
  },
  -- ...
})
```

#### 5. Set Up Home Manager Activation Scripts (Optional)

To make sure all your plugins are installed and ready to go when you start Neovim, use activation scripts -- a mechanism used to set up the system during `home-manager switch`.
Consider it a "build" step for your configuration and a way make your setup idempotent.
In the example below, Lazy.nvim clones git repositories and builds telescope-fzf-native using make during activation phase.

First, ensure that the necessary tools are available during the activation phase.
Note: the packages listed here are available only during activation phase, except if you make them available in other ways.
For example, if you disable Neovim by `programs.neovim.enable = false`, it would still be available during activation phase
to install packages just like `make` or `gcc`, however you won't be able to use it after.

```nix
home.extraActivationPath = with pkgs; [
  git       # For cloning plugins
  gnumake   # For building plugins like telescope-fzf-native
  gcc       # For compiling native extensions
  neovim    # To run Lazy-related Neovim commands during activation
];
```

Then, add the activation script block (the name `updateNeovimPlugins` is arbitrary):

```nix
home.activation.updateNeovimState = lib.hm.dag.entryAfter [ "writeBoundary" ] ''
  # Suppress output unless VERBOSE is set, like when running `home-manager --verbose switch`
  args=""
  if [[ -z "''${VERBOSE+x}" ]]; then
    args="--quiet"
  fi
  # Restore plugins to the versions pinned in lazy-lock.json, builds telescope-fzf-native, etc.
  run $args nvim --headless '+Lazy! restore' +qa
'';
```

This script ensures that when you run `home-manager switch`, Neovim will install all plugins pinned to the versions specified in your `lazy-lock.json`,
and any necessary build steps will be executed. So when you start Neovim, everything is ready to go.

#### Full Example to Copy and Paste

Here's how it all comes together in your `home.nix` file, assuming you're using `home-manager` and `EdenVim`:

```nix
{ pkgs, config, lib, ... }:
{
  # ... Other parts of your configuration ...
  programs.neovim = {
    enable = true;

    # Often required, don't worry as it's isolated in Neovim environment
    withPython3 = true;
    withNodeJs = true;

    # Packes available within Neovim during runtime. Put your LSP Servers, formatters, linters, etc.
    extraPackages = with pkgs; [
      bash-language-server
      buf-language-server
      clang
      lldb
      lua-language-server
      stylua

      yaml-language-server
      terraform-ls
      ruff
      basedpyright
      tree-sitter
    ];
  };

  # Symlink your Neovim configuration (or delete the line to manage .config/nvim directly)
  xdg.configFile."nvim".source = config.lib.file.mkOutOfStoreSymlink "/home/username/dotfiles/config/nvim";

  # Tools available during activation
  home.extraActivationPath = with pkgs; [
    git
    gnumake
    gcc
    neovim
  ];

  # Activation script to set up Neovim plugins
  home.activation.updateNeovimState = lib.hm.dag.entryAfter [ "writeBoundary" ] ''
    args=""
    if [[ -z "''${VERBOSE+x}" ]]; then
      args="--quiet"
    fi
    run $args nvim --headless '+Lazy! restore' +qa
  '';

  # ... Other parts of your configuration ...
}
```

### Future Plans: Flake-based solution for any Lua-based configurations (WIP)

I'm working on a way to make integrating arbitrary Neovim configurations with Nix smoother. This will allow you to wrap your Lua-based Neovim configuration in a Nix-friendly way without changing your code at all, and still keep all your configuration files in `~/.config/nvim`. Stay tuned for updates!
